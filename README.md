## Reflection Questions
1. **What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**  
   I excelled in organizing the document structure, ensuring it was clear and comprehensive. Each section provided specific details for both the client and development team, allowing for effective communication of requirements and technical specifications.

2. **What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**  
   The process clarified the application’s architecture and functionality, making it easier to break down coding tasks. It also helped anticipate challenges, such as ensuring data consistency across multiple platforms.

3. **If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**  
   I would revise the section on scalability by including more detailed use cases and diagrams. This improvement would provide clearer guidance on how to handle high user loads and potential future expansions.

4. **How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design?**  
   I actively incorporated the client's requirements by focusing on user-centric features, such as intuitive navigation, real-time updates for team scores, and cross-platform compatibility. This approach ensured the software met the client's expectations and provided a positive user experience.

5. **Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**  
   Understanding user needs is crucial for creating a functional and engaging application. It ensures that the software solves the intended problem and delivers a seamless experience, ultimately increasing user satisfaction and adoption.

6. **How did you approach designing software?**  
   I began by analyzing the client’s requirements and researching similar applications to identify best practices. I used flowcharts and diagrams to map out the application's structure and functionality. In the future, I plan to incorporate more collaborative brainstorming sessions to gather diverse perspectives during the design phase.
